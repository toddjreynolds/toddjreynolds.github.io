<h4>How can I connect multiple devices with First Verse?</h4>

<p>Connecting to multiple devices with First Verse helps keep the whole family in sync during scripture study. To connect, make sure all devices have First Verse installed and open. Anyone can tap the small people icon in the top right corner of the screen and then invite others to connect. Once connected, anyone can tap the previous or next button to take everyone to the next verse.</p>

<h4>Why can't I select text in First Verse?</h4>

<p>I noticed that kids often read and track with their fingers. Doing so on a device meant a lot of unintended text selection that was a big distraction. I might include a setting in the future that allows text selection to be enabled. Maybe. </p>
          
<h4>What? No swiping to the next verse?</h4>

<p>Nope. I found that allowing swiping to the next verse, caused problems for kids that track their reading with their finger.</p>
          
<h4>Have more questions or feedback?</h4>

<p>If you have other questions or feedback, you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:firstverseapp@gmail.com">firstverseapp@gmail.com</a>, or find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/firstverseapp">@FirstVerseApp</a>. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
